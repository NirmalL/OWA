# Open Weather API

The goal of this project is to provide a working foundation application to be used as a server that records the data frequently collected and sent by probes distributed over a large area of interest.

### The Complete System

This is the server that collects the data and exposes them as an open REST-full API over the web. The client side, assumed to be an IoT device will send simple requests containing the collected data.

### Initial Implementation

The system will initially be developed alongside a few Arduino galileo devices acting as the probes. The data transfer (protocols and data-structures) will be optimized later on.

The code running on the probe can be found (and contributed to) at [open-weather-monitoring-system](https://github.com/dhammika-marasinghe/open-weather-monitoring-system)
