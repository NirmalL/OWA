{"name":"Owa","tagline":"A REST-full Open Weather API application for a distributed realtime data-collecting network","body":"## Open Weather API\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to provide a working foundation application to be used as a server that records the data frequently collected and sent by probes distributed over a large area of interest.\r\n\r\n### The Complete System\r\n\r\nThis is the server that collects the data and exposes them as an open REST-full API over the web. The client side, assumed to be an IoT device will send simple requests containing the collected data.\r\n\r\n### Initial Implementation\r\n\r\nThe system will initially be developed alongside a few Arduino galileo devices acting as the probes. The data transfer (protocols and data-structures) will be optimized later on.\r\n\r\nThe code running on the probe can be found (and contributed to) at [open-weather-monitoring-system](https://github.com/dhammika-marasinghe/open-weather-monitoring-system)\r\n\r\n### The Dev Team\r\n\r\n- Buddhika Kulathilaka\r\n- Sandaruwan Nanayakkara\r\n- [@Dhammika-Marasingha](https://github.com/dhammika-marasinghe)\r\n- [@NirmalL](https://github.com/NirmalL)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
